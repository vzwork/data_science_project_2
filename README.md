# Description
Some hotel company is experiencing losses. Guests reserver their rooms, but don't show up. We need to make a model that will predict whether a person will show up or not. And then the company can ask for a deposit before reservation.

# Business Information
The deposit will cover first night, and costs of one cleaning.

The types of rooms:
- A category: $1000/night $400/cleaning
- B category: $800/night  $350/cleaning
- C category: $600/night  $350/cleaning
- D category: $550/night  $150/cleaning
- E category: $500/night  $150/cleaning
- F category: $450/night  $150/cleaning
- G category: $350/night  $150/cleaning

Season costs adjustment:
- Sprint: 20%
- Summer: 40%
- Fall:   20%

Loss of business is calculated by one night stay and one cleaning

The budget for development of the model is $400,000
